## Day_1 (12 Feb): Input / Output

print(" ")

x = input(" ")

strings concatenation (joins) - only strings { print(" " + 10): TypeError }



## Day_2 (13 Feb): Variables

change ‘age’ -> string: ’18’, to 18 as number using int(age), so that int(age) + 1 is 19 as an integer. 

Constant datatype -> C can, Python cannot (So, use FULL CAPITAL to show the variable should be a constant)

Conversion Uses:
1. str() 
2. int() 
3. float() 
4. bool() 
5. list()
6. tuple()
7. dict()
8. set()

## Day_3 (19 Feb): Math, Relational and Logical Operators

1. Addition: x + y
2. Subtraction: x - y
3. Multiplication: x * y
4. Division: x / y
5. Modulus: x % y
6. Exponential: x ** y
7. Floor Division: x // y -> The floor of a real number x, written as ⌊x⌋, is defined as the greatest integer that is less than or equal to x.


"==" equals to (not assignment of value) <br>
"!=" not equals to # For SQL: "<>" <br>
">" greater than <br>
">=" greater than or equal to <br>
"<" less than <br>
"<=" less than or equal to <br>

print("\n") # New Line :)
