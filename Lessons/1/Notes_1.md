## Day_1 (12 Feb): Input / Output

IDE: Integrated Development Environment 

print(" ")

x = input(" ")

strings concatenation (joins) - <b> only strings </b> { print(" " + 10): TypeError }



## Day_2 (13 Feb): Variables

change ‘age’ -> string: ’18’, to 18 as number using int(age), so that int(age) + 1 is 19 as an integer. 

Constant datatype -> C can, Python cannot (So, use FULL CAPITAL to show the variable should be a constant)

Conversion Uses:
1. str() 
2. int() 
3. float() 
4. bool() 
5. list()
6. tuple()
7. dict()
8. set()

## Day_3 (19 Feb): Math, Relational and Logical Operators

1. Addition: x + y
2. Subtraction: x - y
3. Multiplication: x * y
4. Division: x / y
5. Modulus: x % y
6. Exponential: x ** y
7. Floor Division: x // y -> The floor of a real number x, written as ⌊x⌋, is defined as the greatest integer that is less than or equal to x.


"==" equals to (not assignment of value) <br>
"!=" not equals to # For SQL: "<>" <br>
">" greater than <br>
">=" greater than or equal to <br>
"<" less than <br>
"<=" less than or equal to <br>

print("\n") # New Line :)

## Day_4 (24 Feb): System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) & Algorithms

SDLC:

1. Problem Definition (scope of requirements)
2. Problem Analysis (breakdown the main problem)
3. Design Using Flowchart and Pseudocodes (apply abstaction techniques)
4. Solution Development (translate to code)
5. Testing (test with data)
6. Documentation (version control)
7. Deployment ($$$)
8. Evaluation & Maintenance (scale up & updates)

Algorithms:

1. Problem Definition
2. Problem Analysis
3. Design Algorithm
